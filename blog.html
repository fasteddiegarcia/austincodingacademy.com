The interesting thing to note is that when Austin Coding Academy started, the focus was on working with entrepreneurs to help them control costs with development teams. Over time, the market proved that a lot of people form Austin were stuck in jobs and careers that didn’t have the creativity or challenge that they needed. More and more employees of major Austin employers started coming to Austin Coding Academy to grow their exisiting careers: Graphic Designers started learning HTML and CSS so they could provide better wireframes to the development team. Marketing managers and marketing team members started learning HTML structure to increase their SEO skill set and out-of-the-box optimization toolbox. The list goes on and so does the most affordable and accessible coding education in Texas.

It's been a little while but Austin Coding Academy is officially back. As you can see, our website is full-featured and healthy again, as are our social media and other public facing accounts. Now that we're back and fully in gear, we wanted to give a little explanation into what happened, what it means and how it affects you. We've also made some updates and improvements to the school that we'd like to share, so we'll include those as well. And in the case that you're in a hurry and won't make it past this paragraph, your TL:DR is simply, we're back, better than ever, and would love to have you by the shop to check everything out.
