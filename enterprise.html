            <br />
            <small>
              Every company knows that good veteran developers are as valuable
              as they are hard to find. {{site.title}} helps bring out
              the best in your younger developers by exposing them to an
              advanced education in your technology stack.

            <br />
            <small>
              The best managers are the ones who understand their teams and
              their products the best. Understanding the development process is
              an invaluable trait and its effects are often seen in improved
              intra-team communication and boosted sales.

            <br />
            <small>
              Up to date, custom built curricula, that fit your team. Not "one
              size fits all" classes from 2002. Your customized training program
              covers the skills your team needs and not the ones it doesn't.
              Making sure the training program we build fits your situation is
              what we're all about.

            Cutting Edge Information

            <small>
              Technology changes and your team evolves with that change. What was
              bleeding edge five years ago, might be legacy today. For this reason
              every training program is made "to order", so when our instructors
              build your curriculum, it's with the latest, most up to date
              research, not a pre-packaged course deployed to every client.
