    <small class="text-white">"I just completed the entire Full Stack curriculum at Austin Coding Academy and not only did they help me transition my career into coding, they helped me land a JavaScript Engineering job before I even graduated. The instructors are 'wicked smart', the curriculum is challenging in a good way, and the community is incredibly supportive. I recommend anyone looking to upgrade their skill set or a complete career change to look no further than ACA for the most affordable and flexible option available."

    <small class="text-white">"My classmates are amazing. I've never been surrounded by such serious and determined students. Their hunger and determination servers as great motivation to study and study often. The course work and cirriculum are demanding, but never overwhelming and someone is always available to point you in the right direction. I have completed both the intro and intermediate course at Austin Coding Academy (Austin Campus) and it has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. They truly care about what their students learn and are always there to listen and provide support."
