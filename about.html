              <h1>A Letter to You</h1>
              <br />
              <p>
                Dear You,
                <br />
                <br />
                If you're reading this right now, you've probably gotten to look
                around our site a bit and wanted to know a bit more about the people
                that run this place. We decided the best thing to do was to write
                you a little letter, mostly to say thank you. We want to say thank
                you, not so much for having an interest in our school (though of
                course, we appreciate your visit), but more because we want to
                recognize you for considering something challenging and difficult
                as a way to improve your position in life.
              </p>
              <p>
                It may not seem like a big deal, but believe it or not, most people
                don't even look far outside of their current comfort zone, let alone
                start learning a brand new skill that takes hard work and plenty of
                dedication. {{site.title}} was born out of frustration. We
                were frustrated that we had our liberal arts degrees and weren't
                using them. We were frustrated that tech seemed like such an amazing
                world, but without knowing how to code it seemed like we would always
                be on the outside. We were frustrated that the only ways to learn
                how to code were to either teach ourselves online (we're pretty
                awful at self-teaching; kudos if you can) or pay $15,000 and give up
                3 months of work to go to an intensive bootcamp. It seemed
                ridiculous that their weren't better options.

                    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                      <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RvlytBUgpa4"></iframe>

                What if there were classes that were at night so you didn't have to
                quit your day job or take on extra debt that covered everything the
                full time bootcamps covered? What if you could meet with other
                students on the weekends to help push you? What if you had
                instructors that were full time developers during the day that would
                bring their expertise to class at night? What if you could get help
                at any time with a group chat feature? With all of these "What Ifs"
                we figured there were probably a few other people that felt like us.
                And so, {{site.title}} was born.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each year, we continue to grow, both in numbers of students as well
                as quality of education. We are committed to providing the absolute
                best coding education available while still maintaining affordable
                tuition. Providing affordable, accessible coding education isn't
                enough. We also believe that students need to develop outside of
                technology as well, which is why in class we also focus on important
                values like integrity, mental and physical health, job readiness,
                and a fearlessness of failure.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to spread these values and we select students that we
                feel embody them. If this sounds like you, we'd love to work
                together.
              </p>
