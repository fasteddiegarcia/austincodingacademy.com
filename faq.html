    <small class="text-white">"I just completed the entire Full Stack curriculum at Austin Coding Academy and not only did they help me transition my career into coding, they helped me land a JavaScript Engineering job before I even graduated. The instructors are 'wicked smart', the curriculum is challenging in a good way, and the community is incredibly supportive. I recommend anyone looking to upgrade their skill set or a complete career change to look no further than ACA for the most affordable and flexible option available."

    <small class="text-white">"I was reluctant to attend an immersive course but I wasn't making much progress on my own. I found ACA's flexible option and decided to take the leap. I can honestly say that it was the best investment I've made. From the very beginning, what set ACA apart (and what made me stay) is their open door policy and attention to each student. They are always looking for ways to improve the school based on feedback from the students. They are also building an amazing community full of inspiring and supportive people. I have made friends, gained confidence and found a sweet job thanks to ACA."

    <small class="text-white">"Challenging classes lead by an incredible team! As a (previously) non-technical person it was very very rewarding to learn coding in a way that suited my schedule and pace of learning. The structure and pace of their classes are great and enable you to really choose how and what you'd like to learn. The ACA team is comprised of professionals full of great resources for students to take advantage of. Highly recommend for those wanting to up their skill set or change careers all together."

    <small class="text-white">"Austin Coding Academy was a phenomenal experience for me. I had a little experience in web design and coding, so I knew I would enjoy it, but classes at ACA really pushed that passion forward. Instructors and staff are really driven and so obviously love what they do – they all go the extra mile to make sure you are getting everything you can out of class. ACA really strives to make their environment community-oriented, which allowed me to learn from classmates and even make great friends! I'm astonished at the amount of knowledge I gained in three short months and would recommend ACA to anyone I know."

    <small class="text-white">"The people who run it are awesome and are very motivated to help people learn, hence the low prices. I loved the front-end beginner class (HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript). I had no prior experience with front-end or coding at all, and am now building websites on my own and making a great income from freelance work full-time. It required a lot of learning outside of class and working on things every day is crucial. I loved the productive environment and the teachers are very knowledgable. ACA gave me the right amount of structure, answered all of my questions, and set up a good foundation."

    <small class="text-white">"I love Austin Coding Academy and can not say enough good things about them! ACA not only teaches you Full-Stack Web Development, but also provides you with crucial skills to aide you in finding a job upon (or even before) graduation. Everyone involved with this school is passionate about learning and is completely invested in helping all the students succeed. I was able to build a fantastic network of people not only from the teachers, but from other students as well. Hands down, there is not another coding bootcamp out there where you get this much bang for your buck."

              Absolutely! A lot of students want to get their feet wet first before deciding whether this path is for them. Check out one of our intro courses and then figure out what's next.

              Tuition for each 10-week course is $2,990. If you take the full track of Intro, Intermediate and Advanced, the total tuition is $8,970. Outside of this tuition there are no other books, software, etc. that you need to pay for, however you must bring your own computer. We keep our tuition costs low and pass the saving on to you. Our goal is to provide the most affordable effective tech curriculum in Texas. We work with co-working spaces to keep classroom space costs down and developers who want to give back to keep instruction costs down. This allows us to provide the most powerful coding education in Texas at the lowest price out there.
