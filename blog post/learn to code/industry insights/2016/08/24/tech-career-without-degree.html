<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you wondering what you’ll do with your newfound coding abilities after you graduate? Here at Austin Coding Academy, we’re very proud of our alumni.</span></p>

<p>Recent graduate Christa Clark is a native Austinite, who is using her skills to tackle enterprise-level products for what she happily calls a ‘badass agency with a brilliant group of engineers and designers’.
A natural born traveller who’s explored the world, she’s not a nine-to-fiver. For her, learning to code was a way to embrace her nomadic nature. ‘The idea of working from anywhere and building digital products was really romantic to me,’ says Christa.</p>

<p>Describing her life as a ‘roller-coaster’, Christa rises early to enjoy a quiet hour while the rest of the world sleeps. She finds the silence helps her lucid thinking. After a sweaty workout, she downs a massive butter coffee, and hits the ground running. She works long days, with important breaks for play and creative endeavors!</p>

<p>She’s a coffee-shop worker who contracts, sometimes going into the office. College wasn’t her jam - she tried out a few science and engineering classes, but dropped out, explaining how she ‘wasn’t really sure what [she] wanted to study’. ‘Getting $100,000 in debt for something I wasn’t enthralled in sounded daunting’, she adds. Her introduction to coding started in Middle School - messing with HTML to make her MySpace ‘super stellar’ (shout out to the 90’s kids).</p>

<p>When asked about her hobbies, she laughs and asks ‘does coding count?’. She’s fit - obsessed with finding the perfect diet and exercise plan, currently focussing on paleo and ketogenics. She throws herself into her interests with intensity, applying the same, consuming passion to coding, joking that she’s thankful for choosing it because ‘that’s now something I have a career in’.</p>

<p>I asked her what she did before graduating ACA, and she explained her fascination with the tech industry. A failed Bitcoin startup in 2014, where she worked on marketing and branding, prompted her to learn to code. ‘I’d always been fascinated … particularly [with] cryptography, so when I heard about Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, I completely fell in love with it. In the startup, my friend handled everything technical, but I was always envious that he could actually build the thing I would be selling’.</p>

<p>Startups have an enormous failure rate. She was mesmerized by the success stories, referring to these companies as ‘unicorns’ due to their rarity. ‘It dawned on me that the one constant amongst the founders was an ability to code, and some serious tenacity’.</p>

<p>She dove into the deep end - joining (and winning!) a Startup Weekend competition to develop an app teaching children about finance and saving money. <a href="http://www.capitalfactory.com">Capital Factory</a> offered her an opportunity to build it, but she again found herself limited by her technical aptitude. She looked for a school - and found Austin Coding Academy.</p>

<p>Christa promptly enrolled in the front- and back-end beginner classes. She loved the option to take the class at night - a perfect alternative to the intense commitment of full-time programs. ‘For a few thousand dollars, I got something more valuable than I could have ever asked from a bachelor’s degree. I not only got a new career, but an entirely new way of life! I now have the ability to build my ideas and passion projects, fortunately, many of which I can make money from. Regardless, I love that I’m no longer constrained by budgeting time and money to hire someone to build a digital product for me. I can build it myself, or better yet, manage a team to build it with me; anywhere in the world’.</p>

<p>After completing the course, she started freelancing, designing websites and apps. ‘I couldn’t get enough of it, I could write CSS for 8 hours and not realize it’, she says. ‘Given my new potential for income was so great, there didn’t seem to be any reason for me to go back to University’.
Two years later, she’s the User Experience Designer for <a href="http://skunkworxlab.com/">SkunkworxLab</a>. They’re a digital think tank specializing in building online platforms and architectures, the base for enterprise-level software used by millions of people. Coming full circle, Christa’s team plans to complete her financial app for kids.</p>

<p>I asked her what coding did to her life. ‘Transformed it!’, she responded passionately. ‘It completely did, more than I could have imagined’.</p>
