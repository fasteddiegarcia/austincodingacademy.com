              <h1>10 Reasons Learning to Code Makes You a Better Designer</h1>
              <br />
              <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What goes through your mind when you hear the word</span></p>

<p>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">code_</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>

<p>Long and complicated concepts that only geeks at MIT or Google can fathom, most likely. This fear of the unknown is what hinders many web designers from learning to code.</p>

<p>Coding is becoming increasingly important, especially in the field of web design. Designers who learn to code and have mastered HTML, CSS and other basic programing languages are in high demand, as companies find it more affordable to hire one multi-skilled person instead of separate staff for each role.</p>

<p>Here are ten reasons why every designer should learn to code:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="save-so-much-time">Save SO Much Time!</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once you, the designer, have the basic templates, branding and have created your Photoshop concept, it is simply a matter of coding. Instead of passing the design off to a web developer, you’ll avoid the many inevitable and frustrating back-and-forth email conversations to clarify issues.</p>

<p>You can make global changes to content and any other design elements easily and with greater accuracy. Not having to communicate with a web developer to achieve your vision will definitely save you both time and frustration.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="retain-creative-control-of-your-designs">Retain Creative Control of Your Designs</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When you do the coding yourself, you can execute the designs just the way you want them to appear. Eventually, you may even be able to skip the Photoshop step all together. This is often not the case when the designing and coding are carried out by different people. Consultation between designers and web developers is often limited, time consuming and frustrating, and your design may end up being modified.</p>

<p>The process of coding your own work might take a bit longer but the final product will be more efficient.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="become-a-versatility-ninja">Become a Versatility Ninja</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Creating in code is considerably different than creating in Photoshop. When a designer understands coding, it is much easier for them to be able to create a legible and visually appealing website. As a designer, being able consider elements that vary between operating systems and browser types allows to fine-tune the design - especially the typography - quickly and easily.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="become-a-master-communicator">Become a Master Communicator</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Learning code and knowing how to write it efficiently is an indispensable skill for any designer. Even if you don’t write the code for your designs, being well versed in various programming languages allows you to easily communicate your concept to other web developers and designers.</p>

<p>Understanding basic coding concepts like bootstrap, pixels, line height and divs can help you work with the development team in a company where you are not the one coding your work. As you can see, having even the most primitive understanding of how to write and talk in coding language can give you an edge and make your work more enjoyable and productive.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="better-adapt-to-new-technology">Better Adapt to New Technology</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Technology is always developing, improving and being invented. A few years ago there were no smartphones and designers only had to design websites for PCs. With the range of gadgets with varying browsers and screen sizes, these changes call for developing a website that is flexible.</p>

<p>Modern technology and advancement in programming techniques now allow designers to create interactive and flexible websites. As a designer, you now need to be able to explain how a website behaves rather than merely show the design. Knowing coding concepts can help you arrange content and code dynamic layouts which are easy to use and visually appealing.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="achieve-more-with-less-effort">Achieve More with Less Effort</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Unlike other professions where someone performs best when they stick to doing one thing, web designers who code can combine both skills to achieve optimum performance and give themselves a competitive edge.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding might seem like a herculean task at first, but you’ll be surprised how easy, predictable and rewarding it is. Start with learning how to read and write basic code, and investing time to practice, you’ll be surprised how quickly you will become an expert.</span></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="get-way-more-opportunities">Get Way More Opportunities</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Coding is a highly marketable skill in the modern world, and gives you a competitive edge when looking for a job. It sends the right message to potential employers, who will view you as an adaptable person who is eager to learn new skills.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="become-a-masterful-visionary">Become a Masterful Visionary</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Dream big and create something perfect, but understand that creativity has its restrictions. Websites have to operate within certain parameters, and learning to code enables you to comprehend those technical abilities and limitations. Knowing what is possible and what rules you can bend also helps you to think outside the box, and design your page in a beautiful, functional and creative way without frustration.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="unleash-your-creativity">Unleash Your Creativity</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Just like designing a website needs a lot of creativity, so does writing code. Many designers have the misconception that coding will inhibit their creativity, but in reality it can foster inspiration and broaden your scope of thinking. By learning to code as well as design, you’re opening yourself up to a vast amount of knowledge, options, and abilities to explore.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology has proven over and over that both creativity</span></p>

<p>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">and_</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> knowledge are required for innovation. Without this combination, we wouldn’t have the vast range of amazing smartphone apps, computer games and websites, which run on cutting edge gadgets.</span></p>

<p>Creating such beguiling, complex and beautiful things requires more than creativity alone. Musicians may know how to play their instruments, but without a knowledge of music theory, composition and harmonisation, orchestral compositions wouldn’t be possible. Web designers would definitely benefit by borrowing a leaf from other creative professions!</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h2 id="become-the-designer-you-were-born-to-be">Become the Designer You Were Born to Be!</h2>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>By learning to code, you will be designing with coding in mind. This will make you a more efficient designer, and give you the ability to control the function, look, and usability of the sites you build.</p>

<p>The way content creators and consumers interact with a website is just as important as the way it looks. Knowing how to code allows you to blend beauty with function, and create a site that’s as enjoyable and intuitive to use as it is attractive.</p>
