It’s been a little while but Austin Coding Academy is officially back. As you can see, our website is full-featured and healthy again, as are our social media and other public facing accounts. Now that we’re back and fully in gear, we wanted to give a little explanation into what happened, what it means and how it affects you. We’ve also made some updates and improvements to the school that we’d like to share, so we’ll include those as well. And in the case that you’re in a hurry and won’t make it past this paragraph, your TL:DR is simply, we’re back, better than ever, and would love to have you by the shop to check everything out.
As most of you are probably aware, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/blog/techflash/2016/03/texas-among-tops-in-nation-for-technology-jobs.html">tech jobs in Texas are booming</a>, ranking number two in the nation for tech jobs, second only to California. This is pretty huge given our state’s historically oil and agriculture nature. With any market or industry that has explosive growth, there will be new products and services introduced to cater to that niche’s specific needs. Two years ago there were only a handful of coding schools across the whole state. Now, over the last year alone more than 15 have set up shop across Texas’ various cities. While on its face this is certainly a great thing for the proliferation of coding knowledge, it can be hazardous for consumers and students if there is no standard for the quality of education. Enter the Texas Workforce Commission.</p>

<p>Aside from regulating unemployment benefits, labor law, and generally supporting Texas industry, the TWC also has a <a href="http://www.twc.state.tx.us/partners/career-schools-colleges-resources">Career Schools and Colleges division</a>, whose job it is to maintain quality among schools that train Texans for specific industries. Most traditional vocational schools are required to have licensure by the TWC in order to operate, with the goal being to avoid the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/10/20/closure-for-profit-tech-college-leaves-students-lurch-debt/ICKwmkrR0fCNBY8ySlAAwK/story.html">ITT Techs of the world</a>. With so many coding schools popping up so rapidly across Texas, there was a new challenge for the TWC to figure out: how to ensure the schools were providing a quality education, while also making sure Texans had access to the most up-to-date tech and job training available.The intrinsic nature of a coding school presented a unique problem. Because there is such a demand for developers in the job market, starting salaries are considerably higher than many other careers (in Austin upwards of $65k). This is no different than any other skilled labor position, but what makes this distinct is that the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/21/news/economy/web-developer-job/">timeline from novice to proficient is relatively short</a>. What this means is that the assumed value of a 3 month “boot camp” that could increase your salary by sometimes double (not to mention the sweet job perks of working in tech) is some percentage of the difference between your current salary and $65k. Most boot camps had this pegged around $15,000 for tuition. While this could very well be an equitable exchange, the problems arise when you do the math (20 students x $15K tuition, minus some payroll and expenses = a hefty profit) and see the relatively low barrier to being considered proficient enough to be an instructor. In other words, the profit potential is high and because computer programming is so foreign and arcane to most people, the standard for what counts as an “expert” is pretty low. I’m sure you can see the potential pitfalls if this kind of business model got into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>While ACA has always had a commitment to providing top quality coding education that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, we needed to get licensed as well, and during the licensing process one of the stipulations was that we were unable to advertise or promote classes. This included our website and social media accounts, resulting in the relative silence over the past two months. What’s worth noting is that we want to be very explicit in saying we think the TWC’s regulation of the environment is a great thing. Despite the temporary discomfort we felt in going through the process, implementing standards is one of the first steps necessary to keeping institutional interests consistently aligned with student interests. This is something we’ve been about since the beginning. With all that behind us, though, we are very happy and proud to say that Austin Coding Academy is officially licensed by the Texas Workforce Commission. We look forward to this standard raising the bar for all coding schools in Texas.Even though we’ve been keeping our public accounts on the DL, we’ve been super busy at home. We took the time we normally spend promoting classes and enrolling new students and directed those efforts towards further streamlining our business processes and optimizing our learning experience. One of the biggest questions we always get from people is how we manage to meet or exceed the quality of learning of other full-time coding schools while also keeping tuition costs so low. The short answer is that we work extremely hard examining the elements that make up a first-class education and optimize the ones that truly matter, while doing our best to leave behind the ones that don’t. What this looks like is a surgical attention to detail with our curriculum, an industry leading instructor training and improvement program, and some amazing relationships with community partners. Since we’ve been consistently growing quarter after quarter from day one, the brief respite allowed us to focus even more attention on those aspects of our school. We are excited for students, both future and current as well as returning alumni, to see the fruits of this labor.</p>

<p>Another change you might notice is that our site is now exclusively dedicated to the city of Austin. After much consideration, we’ve decided that Austin Coding Academy will no longer be the umbrella brand for all other campuses, and instead each city’s will be named individually. Hopefully it’s clear in our name, but ACA is a local business. We were founded locally, our instructors are local, and our curriculum is tailored to the local job market. What might not be as obvious is that <em>every other coding school</em> in Austin is from out of state. Austin schools tend to be owned by huge publicly traded companies like <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/news/2016/06/27/san-antonio-computer-coding-bootcamp-leader.html">Apollo Education Group</a> (owners of the University of Phoenix) and <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160115005856/en/Strayer-Education-Acquires-York-Code-Design-Academy">Strayer Education</a>. Even the UT boot camp is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/traditional-universities-are-rushing-into-the-coding-boot-camp-market-2016-8">run by a company</a> based out of New York, that runs the same program at Rutgers, UCLA, and University of Central Florida. While national companies bringing their business to Texas isn’t a bad thing by any means, when it comes to education, it’s important to know what you’re paying for. At ACA we have a local office that focuses on building curriculum and learning experiences specifically for the Austin economy and we are happily registered as a LocallyAustin business, <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/locally-austin">an official initiative by the city of Austin</a> to recognize local businesses. We’ll be excited to introduce San Antonio Coding Academy, Dallas Coding Academy and Houston Coding Academy soon.</p>

<p>So, as a wrap up, we wanted to say a few mentions of thanks to our various community members. First, thanks to you, our reader, for taking some time to hear about what we’ve been up to recently. Thanks to our current and future students for bearing with us. In the short weekend between when we were officially approved and now when this is being released, we’ve already received an amazing number of applications, so we’re grateful for the opportunity to continue to serve despite this minor setback. Thanks to our alumni for working at great companies around Austin and continuing to be great brand ambassadors. Thanks to our community partners, like <a href="https://capitalfactory.com/">Capital Factory</a>, for being amazing support as we grow and for helping to lead the way in creating diversity in the tech industry (for those of you that don’t know, they’ve been instrumental in helping us put together a diversity scholarship). And finally, thanks to our instructors and staff who all worked extremely hard through this process to deliver an amazing product. We’re very excited to continue paving the way for accessible coding education in 2017 and beyond. Please feel free to get in touch if there’s anything we can do for you.</p>
