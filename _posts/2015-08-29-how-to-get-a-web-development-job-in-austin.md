So you want to get a web development job in Austin. Earlier this week, I sat down with my mentor for some coffee to discuss one of my biggest goals for 2016: get a job in Austin's tech industry as a newly-minted Web Developer. By mid-April, I will have finished Austin Coding Academy's Full Stack track and be "job ready". That means I need to start the process now.

Just for some perspective, my mentor - who will remain anonymous - was a founding Senior Developer for one of the most successful startups in Austin for the last 10 years, and has recently left and launched his own startup. Naturally, the discussion turned into some much-needed wisdom and advice.

1. Go To These Two Career Fairs

Yes, people still go to career fairs and still get jobs. Yes, even in the tech industry, and especially at these two career fairs.

# 3. BUILD OUT YOUR PROFESSIONAL NETWORK - BOTH ONLINE AND IN-PERSON



I landed two of my last three jobs through my network. "It's not what you know but WHO you know" is a cliche for a reason and for getting a web development job in Austin, it's no different. If you are already constantly building your online network and going to meetups, kudos, you're a badass. If you need to add some fresh blood, these are great places to get started with immediately:

- [Austin Refresh Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Austin-Web-Design/)

- [Capital Factory Events](https://capitalfactory.com/events/)

- [B.A.S.H.H. (Big Ass Social Happy Hour)](http://www.thebashh.com/)
- [LinkedIn.com](http://www.linkedin.com/)




# 4. FIND A MENTOR IN THE INDUSTRY


Now that you're rubbing elbows in Austin's development community, and your LinkedIn network is growing rapidly, it's time to find a mentor in the tech industry. Try approaching someone whom you've built rapport with at a meetup, or someone you know from another life circle.



It doesn't have to be formal or involve any type of deliverables or agenda, just someone to meet with regularly - say over a coffee or a pint - to casually discuss your job search, your skill set, and provide insight. Their experience alone is going to give you an inside track, especially in the interviewing process. In fact, this relationship could give you the perfect opportunity to...

# 5. PRACTICE MOCK INTERVIEWS & QUESTIONS


Once you have a mentor and have some good rapport, practice a mock interview with them. Most likely, you will stumble a few times and eat some humble pie, but this practice is going to pay enormous dividends, my friend.



GitHub has a great resource of [front-end developer interview questions](http://h5bp.github.io/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/) for interviewers and interviewees. The internet is swimming with example questions and answers, so don't be shy with your googlin' skills.

# BONUS: PAID INTERNSHIPS


If you are still struggling to get your foot in the door, and are willing and able to put in another three months of "on-the-job" training, there are plenty of startups and tech companies (re: uShip, IBM, Dell) that offer decent paid web development internships somewhere in the $25-$28 range. These companies use their internship pools for new hires, and most entry-level jobs are filled precisely this way.



# THE BUMS ALWAYS LOSE, LEBOWSKI!



It's a full-time job finding a job, and every advantage helps. If you are looking to get a web development job in Austin, these five ways will position yourself for not only short-term gains, but long-term success.

Good luck, and may the function be with you.
