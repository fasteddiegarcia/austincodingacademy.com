# **WHY SHOULD I EVEN READ PROGRAMMING NEWS?**


New libraries, paradigms, projects, and opinions are introduced into the programming world on a daily basis. Discovering these exciting, new contributions can be time consuming without knowing where to look. We've compiled a list of resources for programming news so you can stay current and stay informed!



**YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT TO UNDERSTAND PROGRAMMING NEWS**

Very few programming articles are overwhelmingly technical. Authors usually supplement the technical examples with plain English explanations. Even if you don't fully understand the technical details, you can still grasp the concepts that encompass the article.

**IT CAN MAKE YOU A BETTER PROGRAMMER**

Reading programming articles considerably improves your ability to make technical decisions in the workplace. Here are just a few questions that become much easier to answer once you keep up with programming news:

Is there a tool that already does what I'm trying to accomplish?
Are there any drawbacks to the strategy I'm currently implementing?
Is the technology I'm using stable and trusted?
Knowing the answer to these questions can prevent you from reinventing the wheel while also increasing the stability of the project at hand.

**IT SHOWS YOU WHERE PROGRAMMING MIGHT BE HEADED**

Reading new programming articles, as well as community comments regarding the article contents, can give you insight into the direction programming as a whole may be heading.

For example, before many of the current front end frameworks became mainstream, the strategy of offloading business logic to an internal REST API was heavily discussed. Many programmers previously viewed REST APIs as something created when you wanted to expose data/functionality to outside users. However, these articles spurred discussions, ultimately leading to a conclusion that a front end that simply serves to consume a private, internal REST API was a good strategy. Now popular front end frameworks such as AngularJS make this strategy incredibly simple to implement.

**IT'S INSPIRING**

Reading the journeys of other programmers can inspire you to keep your head up while on your own path. While some people started coding at an absurdly young age, you'll find a substantial portion of the community entered the world of programming at a much later point in their lives. Knowing you're in good company in this universe of "but that just worked yesterday!" and "I can't believe that little typo broke everything!" can motivate us to keep at it when things seem complicated.
