Think it takes years to master programming? Well, think again! There are things you can do in your spare time daily to master programming faster. Check out our five tips below.



# 1. Practice Every Day On Real Projects


Like with any other job, having hands-on experience is a must. Work on real projects daily no matter if it's for your personal website or a close friend or family member. The more you practice coding, the more fluent you'll become.

# 2. Use Free Coding Websites For Tutorials And Projects


Another tip to master programming faster is to use free coding websites. There are plenty such as [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [aGupieWare](http://agupieware.com/), and [Code Avengers](http://www.codeavengers.com/) that not only offer free tutorials but cool projects as well. You'll work on an interactive platform presented with real world problems. You'll learn how to create web apps, games, and more. A few languages you'll learn include JavaScript, PHP, and Python, all of which will help you be a stellar coder.

# 3. Make And Use Flashcards


This may seem outdated, but make and use your own flashcards! It worked for learning spelling and math, so it'll do the same for coding. Flashcards are awesome because you can whip them out anywhere and anytime, no matter if you are standing on the bus to work, having an amazing breakfast, or sneaking in some time while in the bathroom. If you feel that is too outdated, create your flashcards online and save them right to the net.

# 4. Blog About It


The best way to master any profession and prove you know what you are talking about is teaching it. If you are capable of clearly explaining and teaching coding, this proves you have a full understanding of the concept.

A great way to teach other's without taking up much of your time is to blog about it. Blogging allows you to reach a wide audience and get feedback from your blog visitors. If you're not that great of a writer, that's ok. You can record yourself and create a video blog (Vlog) to teach your lessons.

# 5. Take A Class Or Boot Camp


Boot camps and classes are another excellent way to master programming faster. Classes are instructor led allowing students to get hands on experience and work directly with professors. Taking a front end or back end track class through an academy such as [Austin Coding Academy](//www.austincodingacademy.com/) takes students through beginning, intermediate, and advanced lessons necessary to prepare for full time developer roles.

Growing with your organization, changing careers, or getting serious about a hobby all starts with mastering the subject matter. If you're a programmer or a future programmer in the Austin area, take a look at how you can master programming with our 10-week courses.
