Inevitably when making the decision to learn how to code, one of the big questions that pops up is, "Which coding language should I learn first?" There are literally hundreds to choose from and understanding the differences between them can be tricky.

Below are some guidelines for choosing the right language, but here's the easy answer up front: Python and Ruby are considered the easiest to pick up for beginners, while [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) are bit more complicated but more versatile.

For a more nuanced answer, though, if you're just starting out, learn whichever language is most enjoyable to you. Just like exercising, learning to play an instrument, or developing any other new skill, the biggest factor in sticking with it – and ultimately being successful – is how much you enjoy it, so pick something that has some appeal in its usefulness for you. We'll get more into that in a minute. First things first.

# WHY ARE YOU LEARNING TO CODE?


With every year, the ability to code becomes a skill with higher and higher value. As Adam Enbar said, "we're entering a world where every job if not already, will be technical. "



Answering this question first will be the best tool in finding the right coding language to learn. Do you want to become a full time developer for a large company? Are you someone with a great design sense who enjoys creating visually appealing projects? Do you have a business idea and want to learn the skills to launch it on your own? Are you simply just looking to pick up a new skill and test the waters a bit?

All of these are valid points of view and whatever answer you gravitate towards will determine which language will be the best use of your time. Here's a quick run down:

If you're highly visual and enjoy the design process learn a front-end language like [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), or [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). These languages are all about interacting with the user and are great for getting your feet wet and producing quick results that you can see. When learning any new skill, getting some early positive results is super important and these three languages are great for that.

If you are interested in back-end or learning a language that is more about computers interacting with each other rather than the user (collecting data for example), [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)) and [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) are wonderful. Both are easy to pick up without being overwhelming and are extremely useful for beginners all the way to professional developers. Additionally, given their practical nature, both Ruby and Python lay a great foundation for learning other languages.

Want to become a developer? C is widely used by developers across many industries but has a steep learning curve. C is considered a "[machine level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language)" language, which means your programs will be interacting with the hardware of the computer directly – allocating memory and processing power for storage and use. If you learn C, you'll be trained to write efficient code and most other languages will seem easy to pick up by comparison. Similarly, Java is a very practical language for app development – particularly mobile apps – and while it doesn't have machine level access like C, it is widely used for development.

## "I equate coding to reading and writing and basic literacy"

# WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO LEARN TO CODE?


The best way to learn any skill is whatever way keeps you engaged and enjoying the learning process. Contrary to common conception, it doesn't take any special talent to learn to code; if you can read, write and do basic math, you can code.



Some people excel when left to their own devices and a Google search bar. Many industry programmers never took a formal class as a beginner, relying on resources available through their peers and online. We encourage everyone to check out sites like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) (free) and [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) (paid) as they're great launch pads for beginners. After getting comfortable with the environment, sign up on [Github](https://github.com/) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) to begin some of your own projects and start asking questions!

Others feel more comfortable in a person-to-person environment. Having a real human to whom you can ask questions, the accountability of seeing classmates on a regular basis, and simple encouragement that comes from knowing others are working on the same skills you are; these are just a few of the huge benefits that are intrinsic to the classroom setting.
At Austin Coding Academy we teach HTML/CSS as our beginner course because it's a great way to jump into the coding world and pick up skills you can take with you wherever you go. We're passionate about what we do and we'd love to help you get started.
